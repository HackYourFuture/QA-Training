# Describe shared testing activities for desktop and mobile

The testing process depends on whether the app is native, hybrid or web but in general, all the applications developed for mobile and desktop should have functional tests, usability, performance, compatibility, security tests.

However the characteristics of this testing activities might differ. For example if we think about compatibility testing, while it can be device compatibility for mobile native apps, it would be browser compatibility for web applications.

Usability testing, for example would focus on different user interactions for these two platforms. For desktop, main user interactions would be through a keyboard, mouse, touchpad, for mobile apps it would focus on touchscreen and gestures are different than desktop, both mobile web apps and mobile native apps can have this gestures of swiping, rotating, pinching etc. while desktop apps most of the time does not (since it is not very common for a desktop computer to have a touch screen)

# Describe unique testing activities per platform

Although most of it is also partly true for web or hybrid apps (but not as challenging as it it for native mobile apps), mobile apps should be tested more for different devices, because there is a lot more variety in terms of devices, operating systems and device manufacturers.

For mobile apps, network should also be taken into account since mobile devices have network through carriers, this might also affect the apps core functionalities, they should be able to perform well under different network conditions.

Mobile apps need installation where web apps don't, so it is important to make sure that it is right to different devices.

Since mobile devices are used in a different fashion than desktop apps, this must also be taken into account. While desktop apps are typically used in an environment where there is an access to a power source, mobile devices are not, so battery consumption should be taken into account more thoroughly.

RAM and storage of the device, hardware limitations, interruptions (for example getting a call while using the app, or app's ability to keep working in the background) should also be taken into account.
