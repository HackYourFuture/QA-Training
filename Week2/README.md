5. ISTQB

### 1. Test Pyramid & Test Layers
In the previous week, you read about agile testing and the common types of testing. Testing pyramid indicates what kind of testing will be more valuable at which stage.

> The "Test Pyramid" is a metaphor that tells us to group software tests into buckets of different granularity. It also gives an idea of how many tests we should have in each of these groups

Learn how testing pyramid help defining testing strategy here:

- [Define Testing Strategy using the Testing Pyramid](https://medium.com/@Colin_But/define-testing-strategy-using-the-testing-pyramid-1dabee37e823)

### 2. Testing Ideas
Now that we defined a testing strategy using the pyramid, we need to consolidate our testing ideas for spesific feature and be able to communicate them through a test plan

Learn how you can do that by reading the following resources:

- [What is Test Scenario? Template with Examples](https://www.guru99.com/test-scenario.html)
- [How to Write Test Cases: Sample Template with Examples](https://www.guru99.com/test-case.html)
- [The One Page Test Plan](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/the-testing-planet-2016/lessons/the-one-page-test-plan)

### 3. Exploratory Testing
> It is a type of software testing where test cases are not created in advance but testers check system on the fly. They may note down ideas about what to test before test execution. The focus of exploratory testing is more on testing as a "thinking" activity.
Exploratory Testing is widely used in Agile models and is all about discovery, investigation, and learning. It emphasizes personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester.

The following course explains exploratory testing and how it's the key to effective testing:

### 4. Debriefing
Communicating your testing results is as important as testing itself, after running exploratiry testing a debriefing session is necessarily

### 5. ISTQB
From *Wikipedia* 
> The International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) is a software testing certification board that operates internationally. ISTQB Certified Tester is a standardized qualification for software testers and the certification is offered by the ISTQB. 

> ISTQB streams focus on:
>- Core – these modules correspond to the “historical” ISTQB certifications 
>- Agile – these modules address testing practices specifically for the Agile SDLC
>- Specialist – these modules are new in the ISTQB product portfolio and address specific 

 ISTQB Foundation Level syllabus stated the principles of software testing, read about them here :
