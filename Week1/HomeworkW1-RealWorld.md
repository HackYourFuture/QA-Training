- Testing buttons for `pagination` in the web. This feature worked as expected. | - While there was no tabs for pagination in mobile app, the test was perform on creating posts on using both 3G and wifi. The creating post feature worked appropriately in both network, but slower in 3G.
- Testing the searching per `popular tags` worked also as expected | - The same, there was no buttons for `popular tags` in mobile version. So, I tested creating post while I was on 3G, at the moment of saving post, I changed to wifi. The post was not saved and did not even appear in the draft.
| - `sharing` button worked appropriately in mobile app.

Shared testing:
test sign up in both laptop and mobile app: results: succeed in the laptop but not in mobile. The button for register seems not working, this was the same when trying to do it offline: it does not show any error or notification, ex: "you are offline". The test was also tried to press login button in the mobile app, the login button worked as expected that there is an error occuredز

Testing creating new article, the desktop copy seems to work well. The edit button did not edit the article when I empty the texts, it kept the previous one. the edit button worked well in mobile app, the notification were posted when trying to empty the fields and it refused to edit

Delete article button is working well in desktop
